# DBS Bank Credit Card Transation Parser

## Motivation

It's pretty annoying that my local DBS Bank in Singapore doesn't allow downloading of transaction in CSV format. Seriously? They only allow downloads in PDF, so what good is that...

So I figured let's make a parser to convert the data to .csv.

## How to use

You'll need to have Elixir installed on your machine.

Clone the repo and run `mix deps.get`.

Open your console and run `iex -S mix`. You are now in Elixir console.
